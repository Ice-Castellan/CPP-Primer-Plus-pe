Please use them with C++ Primer Plus, 6th Edition by Stephen Prata.
The source code files in PE directory are all made by myself.
You can download another reference answer set in http://www.informit.com/content/images/0672326973/downloads/cpp5sol.zip

I wrote Makefile in each directory excluding PE, you can use make to generate the executable files.
You can also:
make cleanobj -- clean the generated object files.
make clean -- clean the object files and the executable files.

Sample Program Lists.

These samples must use the compiler supporting C++11.
It means, if you use g++, you should use -std=c++11 argument.
